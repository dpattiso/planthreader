# planthreader
Threads STRIPS style plans into parallel and interleaves plan "threads", as described in my PhD thesis, "A New Heuristic-Based model of Goal Recognition Without Libraries", 2015.

# Usage
Makes use of JavaFF planning framework, which must be on classpath. See https://github.com/dpattiso/javaff

# Citation

The following paper outlines the idea of planthreader, but is frankly isn't very representative of the final algorithm. Instead, cite the final PhD thesis.
